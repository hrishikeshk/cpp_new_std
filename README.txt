Scratchpad, play with assorted features from new C++ standard using some well known appications.
Tried out :
static_assert, std::function, std::tuple, lambdas, auto types, std::bind, enum classes (advanced_ds) ...

Should try :
function returns with decltype, template aliases (partially fixing a template like typedefs), move constructors and arguments, in-class member declaration and initialization, nullptr, constexpr, variadics (trying with chief_justice), noexcept (functions not willing to handle exceptions and not throwing either), alignas (nice alignment in memory while declaring data types), threading, std::forward, std::array, std::futures, async(), make_unique, make_shared ...
